 <h1>Hey y'all, my name is Yan</h1>

I’m a Python, C and JavaScript programmer and interested in C++ programming. </br>
I’m currently a Software Engineer Student. </br>
I'm 18 years old boy for those who are interested. </br></br>
This account was specifically made to share my project files in Python. </br>
Mostly of these are for scientific purposes or just experimental stuff I've been working. </br>
For those who want to contact me, here's my discord: Kalliboy#8291. </br></br></br>                       
That's it! Thanks for reading!
